Warcab is a tool to record and track battles in an SPWaW campaign.
It is inspired by Campaign Watcher.

Warcab tracks information for core units (including reassignments)
during a campaign. It also shows and tracks information for core,
auxiliary and opponent units during battles and battle turns.

Its current main missing features are data export and printing.
