Warcab is a tool to record and track battles in SP:Waw and winSPWW2 campaigns,
or to record and track turns in standalone battles from scenarios. It is
inspired by Campaign Watcher.

Warcab tracks information for core units (including reassignments) during a
campaign. It also shows and tracks information for core, auxilliary and opponent
units during battles and battle turns.

Its current main missing features are data export and printing.
