ChangeLog
---------

2019-07-19, version 0.8.0

    * Added support for multiple game types (currently SP:WaW and winSPWW2)
        + date-specific OOB nation info and flags
        + map hex connection detection and tramlines
        + unified unit and formation types
        + formations can contain core units as well as support units
        + month-only battle/turn dates

    * New feature - campaign battle results
    The results of a campaign battle (Decisive Victory, Marginal Victory, Drawn
    Battle, Marginal Defeat, Decisive Defeat) are now recorded and reported.
    Note: they are not reported for older dossiers (when battle results were not
    yet recorded).

    * New feature - victory hex statistics reporting
    The occupation status of the victory hexes is now reported for each battle
    turn.

    * New feature - campaign battle index
    The campaign battle index tracks the position of the battle in the campaign,
    compared to other battles. It is used to distinguish and sort the different
    battles of a campaign, replacing the date-based mechanism which did no
    longer function with month-only dates.

    * New feature - tramlines to stratmap
    The stratmap now also shows tramlines.

    * New feature - support local and global configuration storage
    Warcab preferences can now be stored globally (in the registry), or locally
    (in a warcab.ini file).

    * Improvement - much improved unit detection for SP:WaW
    Based on information learned from winSPWW2, the SP:WaW unit detection has
    been much improved, significantly reducing the risk of misdetection.

    * Improvement - initial support for unit designations
    Although unit names are initialized by the games to reflect the unit
    equipment name, these names are actually unit designations which can change
    during the course of a battle and/or a campaign. Initial support for these
    unit designations has been added.

    * Improvement - changed unit 'radio' status to 'contact' status
    The old unit radio status is now reported as a unit contact status (No
    Contact, Radio Contact, Direct Contact)

    * Improvement - updated loaded unit position recording
    For the position of a loaded unit, the position of the loading unit is
    recorded.

    * Improvement - only report battle losses and force turn status when relevant
    These are now only reported for the final (score) turns of campaign battles.

    * Improvement - improved savegame unpacked data handling
    When the size of the savegame section is not fixed (or unknown), buffers are
    auto-allocated to load the uncompressed section data in.

    * Improvement - some cosmetic improvements

    * Fix - dossier/snapshot saving
    Don't destroy existing file if saving fails.

    * Fix - fixed bug not setting dossier info
    The dossier info was not saved in the dossier file and was lost after
    loading the dossier file.

    * Fix - fixed graph horizontal axis label redraw problem
    When moving from battle to battle, the orizontal axis labels where not
    regenerated when the number of items on the axis did not change between
    battles.

    * Fix - fixed some crashes and memory corruptions/leaks

    * Documentation:
        + added SP:WaW and winSPWW2 OOB file format documentation
        + updated SP:WaW save file sections format documentation
        + added winSPWW2 save file sections format documentation

2018-10-03, version 0.7.0

    * New feature - standalone battle dossiers
    Warcab now also supports recording and tracking turns from standalone
    battles from scenarios.

    * Improvement - per-battle OOB data support
    It is now possible to track campaigns even when the OOB data changes, for
    example when SPWaW is updated. Instead of tracking a single OOB data set for
    the entire campaign (and getting an error when trying to add savegames using
    a newer OOB), Warcab now tracks an OOB data set for each battle separately.

    * Improvement - attempts to load/add all selected savegames
    When loading/adding multiple savegames, Warcab will now attempt to process
    all savegames, instead of stopping when it encounters a savegame with an
    error.

    * Fix - unit/formation detection improvements
    The support for scenario-based savegames required many improvements to the
    detection of units, formations, unit types, abandonment status and force
    leader.

    * Small fix - unprintable characters in savegame comment
    Unprintable characters in savegame comments are no longer shown.

    * Small fix - empty battle location in savegame
    Empty battle locations in savegames are now called "unknown location".

    * Other - GUI
    Some dialog box improvements and some new icons.

2017-10-15, version 0.6.3

    * Fixed issue #6:
    Also deploy the required MSVC runtime DLLs.

2017-03-04, Version 0.6.2

    * IMPORTANT NOTE: with the improved unit detection fix for issue #4, the
    list of units detected by Warcab version 0.6.1 and older can be different
    from the list of units detected by this version of Warcab. This means in
    fact that the dossier files created by version 0.6.1 and older are no longer
    compatible with and they cannot be loaded by this release.

    * Fixed issue #3:
    A regression caused battle and turn losses to not be reported.

    * Fixed issue #4:
    The unit detection was not completely accurate.

    * Fixed issue #5:
    The SPWAW2016 solitaire autosave savegame could not be processed

    * New feature - saving stratmap images:
    In recognition of the support by Major Mess in fixing issues #4 and #5, I've
    decided to add a new stratmap image saving feature. This adds a button to
    the stratmap GUI that allows saving an image of the current stratmap. The
    PNG image is saved in the Warcab saves folder. Thanks to this feature it is
    no longer necessary for the Major to perform an elaborate screenshot-cut-
    paste dance just to get the stratmap in a single image file :)


2016-12-17, Version 0.6.1

    * Fixed issue #1:
    MMAS graphs not updated after snapshot load in dossier.
	
    * Fixed issue #2:
    Improved date validity checking. The SPWaW Campaign Generator triggers save
    games with start month '0'.


2016-12-03, Version 0.6

    * First public release.
