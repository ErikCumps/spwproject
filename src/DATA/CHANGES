ChangeLog
---------

2016-03-04, Version 0.6.2

    * IMPORTANT NOTE: with the improved unit detection fix for issue #4, the
    list of units detected by Warcab version 0.6.1 and older can be different
    from the list of units detected by this version of Warcab. This means in
    fact that the dossier files created by version 0.6.1 and older are no longer
    compatible with and they cannot be loaded by this release.

    * Fixed issue #3:
    A regression caused battle and turn losses to not be reported.

    * Fixed issue #4:
    The unit detection was not completely accurate.

    * Fixed issue #5:
    The SPWAW2016 solitaire autosave savegame could not be processed

    * New feature - saving stratmap images:
    In recognition of the support by Major Mess in fixing issues #4 and #5, I've
    decided to add a new stratmap image saving feature. This adds a button to
    the stratmap GUI that allows saving an image of the current stratmap. The
    PNG image is saved in the Warcab saves folder. Thanks to this feature it is
    no longer necessary for the Major to perform an elaborate screenshot-cut-
    paste dance just to get the stratmap in a single image file :)


2016-12-17, Version 0.6.1

    * Fixed issue #1:
    MMAS graphs not updated after snapshot load in dossier.
	
    * Fixed issue #2:
    Improved date validity checking. The SPWaW Campaign Generator triggers save
    games with start month '0'.


2016-12-03, Version 0.6

    * First public release.
