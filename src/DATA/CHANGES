ChangeLog
---------

2018-10-03, version 0.7.0

    * New feature - standalone battle dossiers
    Warcab now also supports recording and tracking turns from standalone
    battles from scenarios.

    * Improvement - per-battle OOB data support
    It is now possible to track campaigns even when the OOB data changes, for
    example when SPWaW is updated. Instead of tracking a single OOB data set for
    the entire campaign (and getting an error when trying to add savegames using
    a newer OOB), Warcab now tracks an OOB data set for each battle separately.

    * Improvement - attempts to load/add all selected savegames
    When loading/adding multiple savegames, Warcab will now attempt to process
    all savegames, instead of stopping when it encounters a savegame with an
    error.

    * Fix - unit/formation detection improvements
    The support for scenario-based savegames required many improvements to the
    detection of units, formations, unit types, abandonment status and force
    leader.

    * Small fix - unprintable characters in savegame comment
    Unprintable characters in savegame comments are no longer shown.

    * Small fix - empty battle location in savegame
    Empty battle locations in savegames are now called "unknown location".

    * Other - GUI
    Some dialog box improvements and some new icons.

2017-10-15, version 0.6.3

    * Fixed issue #6:
    Also deploy the required MSVC runtime DLLs.

2017-03-04, Version 0.6.2

    * IMPORTANT NOTE: with the improved unit detection fix for issue #4, the
    list of units detected by Warcab version 0.6.1 and older can be different
    from the list of units detected by this version of Warcab. This means in
    fact that the dossier files created by version 0.6.1 and older are no longer
    compatible with and they cannot be loaded by this release.

    * Fixed issue #3:
    A regression caused battle and turn losses to not be reported.

    * Fixed issue #4:
    The unit detection was not completely accurate.

    * Fixed issue #5:
    The SPWAW2016 solitaire autosave savegame could not be processed

    * New feature - saving stratmap images:
    In recognition of the support by Major Mess in fixing issues #4 and #5, I've
    decided to add a new stratmap image saving feature. This adds a button to
    the stratmap GUI that allows saving an image of the current stratmap. The
    PNG image is saved in the Warcab saves folder. Thanks to this feature it is
    no longer necessary for the Major to perform an elaborate screenshot-cut-
    paste dance just to get the stratmap in a single image file :)


2016-12-17, Version 0.6.1

    * Fixed issue #1:
    MMAS graphs not updated after snapshot load in dossier.
	
    * Fixed issue #2:
    Improved date validity checking. The SPWaW Campaign Generator triggers save
    games with start month '0'.


2016-12-03, Version 0.6

    * First public release.
