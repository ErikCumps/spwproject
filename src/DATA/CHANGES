    Removed leftover debug code, causing unexpected error.

2021-01-03, version 0.8.2

    * New feature - SP:WaW Mega Campaign support
    It is now possible to track Mega Campaign savegames. Adding a Mega
    Campaign savegame to a new, empty, dossier will allow War Cabinet to
    track this file and the savegame will be automatically added to the
    dossier whenever it changes.
        + Note: for this tracking to be effective, War Cabinet needs to be
	  running in the background while playing the Mega Campaign
        + Note: due to the nature of Mega Campaign gameplay, War Cabinet
	  does not allow battle and/or turn deletions from a Mega Campaign
	  dossier.

    * New feature - read-only mode
    War Cabinet tracks the original savegame folder used with a dossier.
    When a dossier is loaded for which the original savegame folder can no
    longer be found, the dossier will be opened in read-only mode and it
    will not be possible to make any additions or deletions to it.

    * Improvement - simplified game configuration
    The game configuration in the preferences has been simplified. Only the
    game folder must be configured, it is no longer necessary to configure
    both the OOB and the savegames folders separately.

    * Improvement - improved game configuration
    The game configuration in the preferences has been improved. War Cabinet
    now supports up to four different game configurations, each consisting
    of a game type and a game folder. The configurations also have a name
    for easier reference in the New dossier dialog box. Previously, War
    Cabinet only supported a single game configuration for an SP:WaW game
    and a single game configuration for a winSPWW2 game.

    * Improvement - require dossier file overwrite confirmation
    If you use the same name as an existing dossier file while saving a
    dossier, you will be prompted to confirm overwriting the existing
    dossier.

    * Fix - incorrect winSPWW2 battle losses reporting
    The campaign and battle losses recorded in the winSPWW2 savegame were
    incorrectly decoded.

    * Fix - fixed some crashes and memory corruptions/leaks

2020-07-20, version 0.8.1

    * New feature - German Cross Flag
    This new preference can be selected if you do not want War Cabinet to
    display the historic German Flag from WWII for personal reasons or to
    satisfy the requirements of German Law.

    * Improvement - report actual turn battle losses
    List the actual losses during the turn, instead of all losses up to the
    turn.

    * Fixed issue #10:
    Save on exit does not save.

    * Fixed issue #11:
    Be robust against formation or unit count mismatches during battle.

    * Fix - fixed crash
    Crash caused by incorrect formation detection handling.

2020-06-20, version 0.8.0

    * Added support for multiple game types (currently SP:WaW and winSPWW2)
        + date-specific OOB nation info and flags
        + map hex connection and tramlines detection
        + map hex height range expanded and unified
        + unified unit and formation types
        + (SP:WaW) formations can contain core units as well as support units
        + (winSPWW2) month-only battle/turn dates
        + (winSPWW2) Disabled time-based axis for dossier graphs.

    * New feature - Unit History Tracking
    The entire history of units in a campaign is now tracked. This includes
    additional units commissioned after the start of the campaign, units
    decomissioned before the end of the campaign and units cross-attached to
    different formations during the campaign.

    * New feature - full campaign history preference
    This preference enables full campaign history, which also shows data for
    decommissioned units on the following Dossier tabs: Overview, Status,
    Progress, Kills, Losses, Roster and History.

    * New feature - intel mode
    Three intel modes are available (full, limited and none) to select the
    amount of information about the opponent forces that should be available.
        + full: all information is available
        + limited: limited information is available:
            + The opponent's OOB is available, but the battle status is not.
            + The stratmap shows the uncertainty of the frontline.
            + Only destroyed, abandoned or spotted opponent units are indicated.
        + none: no information is available:
            + Victory hex ownership by the opponent is not available.
            + The opponent's OOB is not available.
            + The opponent's unit history is not available.
            + The stratmap shows the uncertainty of the contested map.
            + Only destroyed, abandoned or spotted opponent units are indicated.

    * New feature - additional height color fields for stratmap
    To liven up the stratmap a bit, additional height color fields are provided:
        + grey: the original greyish colors.
        + topographic: washed out colors, derived from topographic maps
        + terrain: washed out colors, based on the map terrain type

    * New feature - campaign battle results
    The results of a campaign battle (Decisive Victory, Marginal Victory, Drawn
    Battle, Marginal Defeat, Decisive Defeat) are now recorded and reported.
    Note: they are not reported for older dossiers (when battle results were not
    yet recorded).

    * New feature - local and global preferences
    Warcab preferences can now be stored globally (in the registry), or locally
    (in a warcab.ini file).

    * New feature - XML reporting
    The spwreport tool now also supports reporting savegame information using
    the XML file format.

    * Improvement - much improved unit detection for SP:WaW
    Based on information learned from winSPWW2, the SP:WaW unit detection has
    been much improved, significantly reducing the risk of misdetection.

    * Improvement - initial support for unit designations
    Although unit names are initialized by the games to reflect the unit
    equipment name, these names are actually unit designations which can change
    during the course of a battle and/or a campaign. Initial support for these
    unit designations has been added.

    * Improvement - changed unit 'radio' status to 'contact' status
    The old unit radio status is now reported as a unit contact status (No
    Contact, Radio Contact, Direct Contact)

    * Improvement - updated loaded unit position recording
    For the position of a loaded unit, the position of the loading unit is
    recorded.

    * Improvement - victory hex statistics reporting
    The occupation status of the victory hexes is now reported for each battle
    turn.

    * Improvement - only show the force progress tab when relevant
    The tab is only shown for the player core force during a campaign.

    * Improvement - only show the support force tab when relevant
    The tab is not shown when there is no support force present.

    * Improvement - only report battle losses/force turn status when relevant
    These are now only reported for the final (score) turns of campaign battles.

    * Improvement - overall improvements for all reports

    * Improvement - campaign battle index
    The campaign battle index tracks the position of the battle in the campaign,
    compared to other battles. It is used to distinguish and sort the different
    battles of a campaign, replacing the date-based mechanism which did no
    longer function with month-only dates.

    * Improvement - improved savegame unpacked data handling
    When the size of the savegame section is not fixed (or unknown), buffers are
    auto-allocated to load the uncompressed section data in.

    * Improvement - some cosmetic improvements

    * Improvement - better separation of Debug and Release deliverables
    This allows deploying both in same target directory.

    * Fixed issue #7:
    MMAS bad min/max unit reporting

    * Fix - dossier/snapshot saving
    Don't destroy existing file if saving fails.

    * Fix - fixed bug not setting dossier info
    The dossier info was not saved in the dossier file and was lost after
    loading the dossier file.

    * Fix - fixed graph horizontal axis label redraw problem
    When moving from battle to battle, the orizontal axis labels where not
    regenerated when the number of items on the axis did not change between
    battles.

    * Fix - fixed terrain height mapping and water hex detection
    Some hexes were incorrectly detected to be below 0 meter or to contain
    water.

    * Fix - fixed (re)sorting bug
    Do not (re)sort if no column is selected for sorting.

    * Fix - fixed ModelHistory
    Fixed bug causing ModelHistory to incorrectly keep using data from previous
    dossier when no data is available for the current dossier. (e.g. when the
    old dossier contained support forces but the new dossier does not)

    * Fix - fixed some crashes and memory corruptions/leaks

    * Documentation:
        + added SP:WaW and winSPWW2 OOB file format documentation
        + updated SP:WaW save file sections format documentation
        + added winSPWW2 save file sections format documentation
        + updated existing and added some new demo dossiers

2018-10-03, version 0.7.0

    * New feature - standalone battle dossiers
    Warcab now also supports recording and tracking turns from standalone
    battles from scenarios.

    * Improvement - per-battle OOB data support
    It is now possible to track campaigns even when the OOB data changes, for
    example when SPWaW is updated. Instead of tracking a single OOB data set for
    the entire campaign (and getting an error when trying to add savegames using
    a newer OOB), Warcab now tracks an OOB data set for each battle separately.

    * Improvement - attempts to load/add all selected savegames
    When loading/adding multiple savegames, Warcab will now attempt to process
    all savegames, instead of stopping when it encounters a savegame with an
    error.

    * Fix - unit/formation detection improvements
    The support for scenario-based savegames required many improvements to the
    detection of units, formations, unit types, abandonment status and force
    leader.

    * Small fix - unprintable characters in savegame comment
    Unprintable characters in savegame comments are no longer shown.

    * Small fix - empty battle location in savegame
    Empty battle locations in savegames are now called "unknown location".

    * Other - GUI
    Some dialog box improvements and some new icons.

2017-10-15, version 0.6.3

    * Fixed issue #6:
    Also deploy the required MSVC runtime DLLs.

2017-03-04, Version 0.6.2

    * IMPORTANT NOTE: with the improved unit detection fix for issue #4, the
    list of units detected by Warcab version 0.6.1 and older can be different
    from the list of units detected by this version of Warcab. This means in
    fact that the dossier files created by version 0.6.1 and older are no longer
    compatible with and they cannot be loaded by this release.

    * Fixed issue #3:
    A regression caused battle and turn losses to not be reported.

    * Fixed issue #4:
    The unit detection was not completely accurate.

    * Fixed issue #5:
    The SPWAW2016 solitaire autosave savegame could not be processed

    * New feature - saving stratmap images:
    In recognition of the support by Major Mess in fixing issues #4 and #5, I've
    decided to add a new stratmap image saving feature. This adds a button to
    the stratmap GUI that allows saving an image of the current stratmap. The
    PNG image is saved in the Warcab saves folder. Thanks to this feature it is
    no longer necessary for the Major to perform an elaborate screenshot-cut-
    paste dance just to get the stratmap in a single image file :)


2016-12-17, Version 0.6.1

    * Fixed issue #1:
    MMAS graphs not updated after snapshot load in dossier.
	
    * Fixed issue #2:
    Improved date validity checking. The SPWaW Campaign Generator triggers save
    games with start month '0'.


2016-12-03, Version 0.6

    * First public release.
