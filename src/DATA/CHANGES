ChangeLog
---------

2016-03-04, Version 0.6.2

    * Fixed issue #3:
    A regression caused battle and turn losses to not be reported.

    * Fixed issue #4:
    The unit detection was not completely accurate.

    * Fixed issue #5:
    The SPWAW2016 solitaire autosave savegame could not be processed

    * New feature - saving stratmap images:
    In recognition of the support by Major Mess in fixing issues #4 and #5, I've
    decided to add a new stratmap image saving feature. This adds a button to
    the stratmap GUI that allows saving an image of the current stratmap. The
    PNG image is saved in the Warcab saves folder. Thanks to this feature it is
    no longer necessary for the Major to perform an elaborate screenshot-cut-
    paste dance just to get the stratmap in a single image file :)


2016-12-17, Version 0.6.1

    * Fixed issue #1:
    MMAS graphs not updated after snapshot load in dossier.
	
    * Fixed issue #2:
    Improved date validity checking. The SPWaW Campaign Generator triggers save
    games with start month '0'.


2016-12-03, Version 0.6

    * First public release.
