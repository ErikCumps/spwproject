Welcome to spwreconstruct.exe, the savegame reconstruction tool.

Overview
--------

  The spwreconstruct tool reconstructs SP:WaW and winSPWW2 savegames from a set
  of uncompressed data sections (as generated by spwdecompose).
  
  The currently known data items in the savegame sections are documented in the
  "SPWAW_records.doc" and "winSPWW2_records.doc" files.

  
Usage
-----

  Usage: spwreconstruct.exe GAME DIR INDEX
  Where: GAME    game type
         DIR     path to savegame dir
         INDEX   index of savegame to reconstruct
  
  Supported game types:
      SPWAW       SPWaW
      WINSPWW2    winSPWW2
  
  The savegame is reconstructed, from separate sections, from the current directory.

  in the current directory, do:

  To reconstruct the winSPWW2 in slot number 82, from the section files in the
