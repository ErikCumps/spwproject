Welcome to spwreport.exe, the multi-purpose spwawlib tool.

Overview
--------

The spwreport tool is a multi-purpose spwawlib tool that can be used to:

  * Generate OOB dumps in CSV format for SP:WaW and winSPWW2 OOB data files
  * Generate reports for SP:WaW and winSPWW2 savegames
  * Generate reports for spwawlib snapshot files


Generating OOB dumps
--------------------

This tool can generate OOB dumps in CSV format (spwoobdump_*.csv files).

  Usage: spwreport.exe oobdump GAME OOB [raw]
  Where: GAME    game type
         OOB     path to oob dir
         raw     specify "raw" for a raw oob data dump

The OOB files are dumped in CSV format in the current directory.

The currently known data items in the OOB files are documented in the
"SPWAW_oob.doc" and "winSPWW2_oob.doc" files.


For example:

To dump the SP:WaW OOB data, do:

  C:\path\to\spwreport.exe oobdump c:\path\to\spwaw

To dump the winSPWW2 OOB data, do:

  C:\path\to\spwreport.exe oobdump "c:\path\to\winspww2\Game Data\OOBs"



Generating reports for savegames
--------------------------------

This tool can generate multiple types of savegame reports:

  Usage: spwreport.exe savereport GAME OOB DIR INDEX BASE [TYPE]
  Where: GAME    game type
         OOB     path to oob dir
         DIR     path to savegame dir
         INDEX   index of savegame to generate report for
         BASE    basename for report files
         TYPE    optional type of report to generate (defaults to ALL reports)

  Supported game types:
    SPWAW       SP:WaW
    WINSPWW2    winSPWW2

  Supported report types:
    raw         raw savegame content reports (*_RAW.txt and *_RAWLINK.txt)
    elaborate   an elaborate report (*_complete.txt)
    normal      a normal report (*_short.txt)
    narrative   a normal report in a narrative format (*_narrative.txt)
    table       a normal report in table format (*_table.txt)
    map         a map and unit positions dump (*_positions.dump)

  Two reports are generate for elaborate, normal, narrative and table reports:
  + a full report covering the full player1 and player2 forces
  + a core report covering the player1 core force only.

The report files of the requested types are created in the current directory,
all report files share the same BASE prefix.

Note: a snapshot file of the savegame will also be created.


For example:

To generate all types of reports for the SP:WaW savegame from slot number 42, as
files in the current directory all starting with the "REPORT42_" prefix, do:

  C:\path\to\spwreport.exe savereport SPWAW c:\path\to\spwaw c:\path\to\spwaw\SAVE 42 REPORT42_

To generate all types of reports for the winSPWW2 savegame from slot number 84,
as files in the current directory all starting with the "REPORT84_" prefix, do:

  C:\path\to\spwreport.exe savereport SPWAW "c:\path\to\winspww2\Game Data\OOBs" "c:\path\to\winspww2\Saved Games\" 42 REPORT42_



Generating reports for snapshot files
-------------------------------------

This tool can generate multiple types of snapshot reports:

  Usage: spwreport.exe snapreport SNAP BASE [TYPE]
  Where: SNAP    filename of snapshot to generate report for
         BASE    basename for report files
         TYPE    optional type of report to generate (defaults to ALL reports)

  Supported report types:
    raw         raw savegame content reports (*_RAW.txt and *_RAWLINK.txt)
    elaborate   an elaborate report (*_complete.txt)
    normal      a normal report (*_short.txt)
    narrative   a normal report in a narrative format (*_narrative.txt)
    table       a normal report in table format (*_table.txt)
    map         a map and unit positions dump (*_positions.dump)

  Two reports are generate for elaborate, normal, narrative and table reports:
  + a full report covering the full player1 and player2 forces
  + a core report covering the player1 core force only.

The report files of the requested types are created in the current directory,
all report files share the same BASE prefix.


For example:

To generate all types of reports for the "mysnapshot.snap" snapshot file, as
files in the current directory all starting with the "REPORT" prefix, do:

  C:\path\to\spwreport.exe snapreport mysnapshot.snap REPORT
