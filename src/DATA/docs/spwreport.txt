Welcome to spwreport.exe, the multi-purpose spwawlib tool.

Overview
--------

The spwreport tool is a multi-purpose spwawlib tool that can be used to:

  * Generate OOB dumps in CSV format for SP:WaW, winSPWW2 and winSPMBT OOB data files
  * Generate reports for SP:WaW, winSPWW2 and winSPMBT savegames
  * Generate reports for spwawlib snapshot files


Generating OOB dumps
--------------------

This tool can generate OOB dumps in CSV format (spwoobdump_*.csv files).

  Usage: spwreport.exe oobdump GAME OOB [raw]
  Where: GAME    game type
         OOB     path to oob dir
         raw     specify "raw" for a raw oob data dump

  Supported game types:
    SPWAW       SP:WaW
    WINSPWW2    winSPWW2
    WINSPMBT    winSPMBT

The OOB files are dumped in CSV format in the current directory.

The currently known data items in the OOB files are documented in the
"SPWAW_oob.doc", "winSPWW2_oob.doc" and "winSPMBT_oob.doc" files.


For example:

To dump the SP:WaW OOB data, do:

  C:\path\to\spwreport.exe oobdump SPWAW c:\path\to\spwaw

To dump the winSPWW2 OOB data, do:

  C:\path\to\spwreport.exe oobdump WINSPWW2 "c:\path\to\winspww2\Game Data\OOBs"

To dump the winSPMBT OOB data, do:

  C:\path\to\spwreport.exe oobdump WINSPMBT "c:\path\to\winspmbt\Game Data\OOBs"



Generating reports for savegames
--------------------------------

This tool can generate multiple types of savegame reports:

  Usage: spwreport savereport GAME OOB DIR INDEX BASE [TYPE]
      or spwreport savereport GAME OOB DIR NAME  BASE [TYPE]
  Where: GAME    game type
         OOB     path to oob dir
         DIR     path to savegame dir
         INDEX   numerical index of savegame to generate report for
         NAME    basename of savegame to generate report for
         BASE    basename for report files
         TYPE    optional type of report to generate (defaults to ALL reports)
           
  Supported game types:
    SPWAW       SP:WaW
    WINSPWW2    winSPWW2
    WINSPMBT    winSPMBT

  Supported report types:
    raw         raw savegame content reports (*_RAW.txt and *_RAWLINK.txt)
    elaborate   an elaborate report (*_complete.txt)
    xml         an elaborate report in XML format (*_complete.xml)
    normal      a normal report (*_short.txt)
    narrative   a normal report in a narrative format (*_narrative.txt)
    table       a normal report in table format (*_table.txt)
    shortxml    a normal report in XML format (*_short.xml)
    map         a map and unit positions dump (*_positions.dump)

  For the elaborate, xml, normal, narrative, table and shortxml report types,
  two different reports are generated:
  + a full report covering the full player1 and player2 forces
  + a core report covering the player1 core force only

The report files of the requested types are created in the current directory,
all report files share the same BASE prefix.

Note: a snapshot file of the savegame will also be created.


For example:

To generate all types of reports for the SP:WaW savegame from slot number 42, as
files in the current directory all starting with the "REPORT42_" prefix, do:

  C:\path\to\spwreport.exe savereport SPWAW c:\path\to\spwaw c:\path\to\spwaw\SAVE 42 REPORT42_

To generate xml reports for the winSPWW2 savegame from slot number 84, as files
in the current directory all starting with the "REPORT84_" prefix, do:

  C:\path\to\spwreport.exe savereport WINSPWW2 "c:\path\to\winspww2\Game Data\OOBs" "c:\path\to\winspww2\Saved Games\" 84 REPORT84_ xml

To generate table reports for the winSPMBT savegame from slot number 21, as
files in the current directory all starting with the "REPORT21_" prefix, do:

  C:\path\to\spwreport.exe savereport WINSPMBT "c:\path\to\winspmbt\Game Data\OOBs" "c:\path\to\winspmbt\Saved Games\" 21 REPORT21_ table



Generating reports for snapshot files
-------------------------------------

This tool can generate multiple types of snapshot reports:

  Usage: spwreport.exe snapreport SNAP BASE [TYPE]
  Where: SNAP    filename of snapshot to generate report for
         BASE    basename for report files
         TYPE    optional type of report to generate (defaults to ALL reports)

  Supported report types:
    raw         raw savegame content reports (*_RAW.txt and *_RAWLINK.txt)
    elaborate   an elaborate report (*_complete.txt)
    xml         an elaborate report in XML format (*_complete.xml)
    normal      a normal report (*_short.txt)
    narrative   a normal report in a narrative format (*_narrative.txt)
    table       a normal report in table format (*_table.txt)
    shortxml    a normal report in XML format (*_short.xml)
    map         a map and unit positions dump (*_positions.dump)

  For the elaborate, xml, normal, narrative, table and shortxml report types,
  two different reports are generated:
  + a full report covering the full player1 and player2 forces
  + a core report covering the player1 core force only

The report files of the requested types are created in the current directory,
all report files share the same BASE prefix.


For example:

To generate all types of reports for the "mysnapshot.snap" snapshot file, as
files in the current directory all starting with the "REPORT" prefix, do:

  C:\path\to\spwreport.exe snapreport mysnapshot.snap REPORT
