Welcome to spwreconstruct.exe, the savegame reconstruction tool.

Overview
--------

The spwreconstruct tool reconstructs SP:WaW, winSPWW2 and winSPMBT savegames
from a set of uncompressed data sections (as generated by spwdecompose).

The currently known data items in the savegame sections are documented in the
"SPWAW_records.doc", "winSPWW2_records.doc" and "winSPMBT_records.doc" files.
