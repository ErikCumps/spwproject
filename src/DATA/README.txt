warcab.exe
----------

  Warcab is a tool to record and track battles in SP:Waw, winSPWW2 and winSPMBT
  campaigns, or to record and track turns in standalone battles from scenarios.
  It is inspired by Campaign Watcher.

  Warcab tracks information for core units (including reassignments) during a
  campaign. It also shows and tracks information for core, auxilliary and
  opponent units during battles and battle turns.

  Its current main missing features are data export and printing.
