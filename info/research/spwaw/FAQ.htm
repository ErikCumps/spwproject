<h4>Icarus Matrix Recruit Member # 3653 posted July 03, 2001 12:25 AM </h4>

<p>I have just finished downloading the game (ver5.3) and played through the
tutorials. I'm very much a beginner when it comes to World War II wargaming and
was wondering if someone could recommend some good scenarios to begin with or
even a campaign with a suggested core force. </p>

<h4>Warrior Matrix Veteran Member # 1760 posted July 03, 2001 12:50 AM </h4>

<p>Want some fun? Just take them in order as they appear in the menu. By the
time you finish the first page, you'll be an expert. Do the campaign after you
finish the first page of scenarios. </p>

<h4>Paul Vebber Administrator Member # 24 posted July 03, 2001 01:10 AM </h4>

<p>1) READ THE MANUAL <br>
2) What Warrior said<br>
3) Play by email or online against real humans! You will learn the most from
3), then 1), then 2)... but do them in the above order, since 3 takes a long
time. (I'm still getting taught frequent lessons </p>

<h4>Wild Bill Matrix General Staff Member # 62 posted July 03, 2001 02:49 AM </h4>

<p>Try the &quot;Lightning Strikes&quot; scenario. It's a rather small airborne
battle and a lot of fun to play. </p>

<h4>Jeffery Lau Matrix Recruit Member # 3539 posted July 03, 2001 10:56 AM </h4>

<p>I am new to the game as well but finishing playing the first page scenarios
will help a lot </p>

<p>You might want to tweak the infantry toughness as the version 5.3 [Editor's
note: and higher] make the infantry tough to kill and been a beginner, killing
is the best reward for playing the game </p>

<h4>Paul Vebber Administrator Member # 24 posted July 03, 2001 11:48 AM </h4>

<p>Yes with starting out - try setting infantry toughness, and arty vs. soft to
70-80. And shy away form scenarios where you are assaulting entrenched opponents.
Setting special OpFire frequency to 50 will let you get the hang of maneuver
without being blasted quite so much. </p>

<p>The big tactical thing to remember in 5.3 (and this carries over to 6.0 too)
is use MGs from long range (like 10 or 15 hexes) to suppress defenders where
only their MGs can fire back - if his MGs are engaging your MGs at log range it
will save countless lives up close...SP-AA guns work the best at this...they
can hang back on hills 20 or 25 hexes away if the vis supports it and hose down
the enemy trenches. </p>

<p>Avoid moving in the open like the plague and if under the enemy guns, never
more than one hex. If assaulting across open ground your plot of initial barrage
should be a bit (2-4 hexes) in front of where you think the enemy is. This will
often expose mines, leave some amount of smoke to cover your approach, and
&quot;create&quot; some cover with shell holes (though this only helps you once
you get pinned). Too much smoke if you don't have a good amount of artillery to
lay in behind it can help the enemy by preventing your suppressive fires and
leave you very vulnerable coming out of the smoke at close range against well
ordered troops. </p>

<p>Pinned status can be your friend. Be careful if your troops are caught in
the open to NOT rally them back past pinned, but to keep your men pinned while
the lay in suppressive fires. Especially in shell holes...While you can't pin
your troops per say, I have found in emergencies a little &quot;Z&quot; key
fire on my own guys to get them back to pinned has been a life saver...consider
it a surrogate for a &quot;go to pinned&quot; status key </p>

<p>Once your firebase is established and your MGs and pinned troops lay in a
good volume of fire, use your maneuver element to probe a flank or generally
advance as the covered approaches allow. A rolling mortar barrage ahead of them
to make sure anyone they meet is at least shaken up a bit will help. </p>

<p>Keep your platoons together advancing and have the company CO accompany the maneuver
element to make sure they get the extra rally chance. The command range of
leaders is 3 hexes, if greater their radio may not always be working. I always
pick the platoon leader with the best rally rating to be my assault team
leader. IF you have inf AT or recon teams, have them advance 2-4 hexes in front
of your assault team to find and pin enemies. Your assault platoon can either
go after them or avoid. </p>

<p>Infantry tactics have dominated discussion lately, but Tank tactics use
similar techniques. use bound and overwatch - For a company I try to leave one
platoon back at long range on hills, in cover to engage at long range - then
play leap frog with the other two platoons to advance - one remaining
stationary and the other advancing in a zig zag keeping about 30 degrees angle
to the threat axis. This maximizes the slope effects against your armor. It is
most effective with &quot;boxy&quot; tanks like Tigers and Matildas. Panthers
and T-34s that have well sloped tough fronts, but thin sides have to be careful
not expose to much side face or you may do more harm than good zig-zaging too
much... </p>

<h4>Lukke Matrix Recruit Member # 3601 posted June 25, 2001 12:15 PM Topic: How
do I take out enemy aircraft?</h4>

<p>I'm extremely new at playing SP:WaW, and I've tried the &quot;Preparing the
way&quot; campaign. A problem I have is that the French aircrafts always blows
up a few tanks and kill a number of soldiers before I can reach the enemy
ground troops. </p>

<p>What is the best way to defend/cover from aircraft? I purchased a few
AA-guns, but they didn't help much. </p>

<h4>FrankyVas Matrix Veteran Member # 685 posted June 25, 2001 01:31 PM </h4>

<p>Buy More AA guns and spread out your forces. The computer, and humans, tend
to bomb the same target two turns in a row. If you get bombed, move and don't
move anything into the area that got bombed. Also, buy more AA guns. Place them
in your forces' flanks. Stager them. The French only have a couple of airplanes
anyways. </p>

<h4>Grumble Matrix Veteran Member # 429 posted June 25, 2001 01:54 PM </h4>

<p>Make sure your AAA weapons are properly sited. Unfortunately, the best
locations for AA work, are usually the most exposed to ground fire. Use M15/16
AA half-tracks to keep the &quot;Bubble&quot; moving with your troops. 40mm and
90mm weapons should be well back in terrain that allows them to engage at their
max ranges-or close to it. Since your troops won't have a lot of experience
initially, you will have to compensate by buying more weapons. good luck. </p>

<h4>Lukke Matrix Recruit Member # 3601 posted June 25, 2001 03:12 PM </h4>

<p>Ok, the thing is, I tried to test the value of AA-weapons by buying almost
only AA, just to test them on their airplanes, however they just flew by and
bombed as usual and was hardly hit at all.. </p>

<p>I must be doing something wrong? </p>

<p>Are you able to see the planes? Check your visibility. They may be out f
visual range. </p>

<h4>john g Matrix Veteran Member # 1520 posted June 25, 2001 05:13 PM </h4>

<p>I always thought the nastiest weapon against planes was the German quad
20mm, either towed or self propelled. A couple dozen of those sprinkled about
means sure death to any fliers. When I played my German WWII campaign, for
43-45 at least half of my support points went for them each battle against the
plane happy US. From 2/43 onward I didn't lose more than a couple of units to air
strikes and never lost any armor. I lost all confidence in the power of
aircraft to affect the battle during that period. I shot down as many as 24
aircraft per battle, most of them before they attacked. thanks, John. </p>

<p>When the games &quot;diverge&quot; and this starts to happen a lot -try
saving the game and having one person send the save to the other players and
restarting form the common save. Format eh online games I've played this
&quot;divergence&quot; is VERY rare when playing on my home LAN, and gets worse
as the game goes on, particularly the more people are playing. I have not had
time to try it but if this is indeed what is happening then every 5 or 6 turns,
&quot;resynching&quot; from a common save should help the problem. The 3 way a
game I played with Bart and Alby there was only one really bad problem were my
shots were not &quot;getting through&quot; and the unit kept resetting back to
its full complement of men, and &quot;phantom&quot; response OpFire was generated.
A couple incidents of firing at the previous target (which some folks would
consider a feature), but all told out of the hundreds of shots I think there
were maybe a dozen or problems. The architecture was not designed to be
interactive to the extent we made it. </p>

<h4>skukko Matrix Veteran Member # 1693 posted November 08, 2001 12:43 PM </h4>

<p>Onliner: send your OOBs to starter, or he sends to you. Otherwise game can
crash to desktop at the first handshake. And for saved game: Host sends save-file
</p>

<h4>Redleg Matrix Veteran Member # 420 posted November 08, 2001 12:57 PM </h4>

<p>There has been much written on these topics in the Combat Command forum from
a while back that may be useful. </p>

<p>As Stukko says, OOBs are critical. When people mess with their OOBs, they no
longer work PBEM or on-line unless you can find someone who is willing to
change OOBs for a battle. </p>

<p>Both players must have exactly the same scenario in order to play on-line.
Critical or you get crashes. </p>

<p>Now that Combat Net is workable again, it is far easier to set up an on-line
game from there than attempting to do this via email, telephone, ICQ. </p>

<p>Online is very tough without reliable, high speed transmission. </p>

<p>Online plays much more smoothly and quickly with OpFire turned off. </p>

<p>It will often take 2-3 hours to play even a small battle online so players
must plan for it. </p>

<p>3-4 player battles online is, without a doubt, the most fun (and difficult
to set up) form of SP:WaW play I have ever experienced. Coordinating between
team members is just great! </p>

<p>Finally. If scenarios are to be used, they should be selected with care. The
typical AI scenario will not work well online because of balancing issues.
Player coordination should include looking at these battles beforehand to see
if they are amenable to online play. We need lots of scenarios designed
expressly for on-line play. </p>

<h4>sebagonzalez Matrix Veteran Member # 4252 posted November 08, 2001 01:47 PM

<p>As in most turn based games, with a 56K conn you have more than sufficient
speed to afford an online game. I have been playing turn based games online
since 4 years ago and 56K can deal with them without problems. In fact, u don&#8217;t
need more than 56k to play this game online. I can tell by my experience when
we played a 4 way, being in different continents, (Europe, North America and
south America), all with 56k and with not problem at all in the 18 turns. Of
course, the faster the conn is, the less lag u will have, but 56K, is more than
enough, and from this speed over, is over, over, over enough. This is just to
make people leave the prejudices that with their 56K conn they cant play this
game, maybe cause there experience they had playing other kind of games, specially
real time ones where u need a fast conn or the game can become the personification
of Lag. </p>

<p>Now a Tip: In my experience, I used Combat Net for launching the games, and
it has many problems that make some times people lost conn in middle of a game,
though you can save the game, is very annoying. So after I started to use
Combat Net as just a meeting point where we share IP´s, then I had no problems
since then with disconnections. That&#8217;s all by now, I will post anything more as
long as I remember. </p>

<h4>Redleg Matrix Veteran Member # 420 posted November 05, 2001 02:51 AM</h4>

<p>See the post at Combat Command forum for a quick and easy fix. I did it
today and it works like a champ. Now we need to get some players visiting
there.<br>
<br>
Here's the instructions from David H.<br>
<br>
We have tracked down the problem with Combat Net. The problem is a setting in
the ini file. Below is what you need to change. Its Very simple and anyone can
do it.<br>
<br>
Using notepad go to your windows directory and open the file &quot;gs.ini&quot;
and edit the following lines in your gs.ini file. Please note you may only need
to change one line is some cases or both. You will find these two lines near
the bottom of the gs.ini.<br>

<h4>sebagonzalez Matrix Veteran Member # 4252 posted November 06, 2001 06:31 AM</h4>

<p>I tried this but it does not work for me so I guess it should not for many
others. For the other guys that can make it with this, just make a new account
each time u get to combat net and the program will let u log in always. In
order to avoid problems, just add a number to your username each time u log in
to Combat net, for example<br>
GraffSpee1 GraffSpee2, so on. </p>

How do I get started PBEM? </h4>

<p>Where can I find detailed info about how to use PBEM? I want to get going
with this and can't find what I need. </p>

<h4>Warrior Matrix Veteran Member # 1760 posted June 25, 2001 06:40 PM </h4>

<p>The first step is to get the PBEM helper, which is a very nice free program
which facilitates PBEM. You can get it here: http://www.sci.fi/~fuerte/PBEM.zip
or I can email it to you (size 2.42Mb). As soon as you install it check readme
for proper settings, it's really quite simple. </p>

<p>I'm a relative newcomer to PBEM myself, and it's amazingly easy. Of course,
you need an opponent (I volunteer), and you can either use scenarios from the
game, or make custom battles using the game battle generator on the scenario
menu page. The manual has a bit about PBEM on page 15, but the best way is to
just jump in (I volunteer to help) and get started. There's also a Opponent
Registry you can look into, but I've never gotten he hang of that. Before
starting a game, you and your opponent need to agree on any rules, i.e., limit
off-board artillery or air, etc. Email me at: bird_guy@bellsouth.net if I can
help or offer advice. </p>

<h4>Mikimoto Matrix Veteran Member # 1787 posted November 08, 2001 10:24 AM </h4>

<p>Perhaps the most important thing playing PBEM is that you must buy more
recon assets than normally, because you can't check enemy movement (in the
replay VCR) and you want to track where are enemy troops. </p>

<p>Uh, well, perhaps most important thing is to agree with your opponent about
force composition to buy and type of battle to fight... </p>

<p>When playing SECURE GAMES ... -Especially within tournaments- A master who
set a human vs. human battle and send the game's files to player1 for him to
play them against player2 (the master is meant to be out of the competition he
is a third fellow) often causes a PLAYER's installation OOB corruption.. this
may bring to one player unable to load game files during a PBEM session...from
which turn this happens is unpredictable.. but that battle is over... The only
way to handle this problem is (as Paul Vebber suggested to me ) </p>

<p>Learned this tip from Skukko: If its a non-league/ladder game, don't forget
about the 'reinforcements' button on the headquarters screen. You get 20% of
your original buy points, but 1/2 of these points are added to your opponents
score (not a big problem in a win/lose single battle, but may affect league
standings). Also remember these units appear at the map edge, so make sure that
they can either fight from there (arty), or they're speedy enough to reach the
front lines in time. These units will have 'AUX' in their on-screen
descriptions.</p>

<p>Actually experience is gained every time your units fire their weapons. The
kills are basically there for &quot;show&quot; they count some, but not as much
as &quot;being in the thick if things&quot;</p>

<h4>Paul Vebber Administrator Member # 24 posted July 24, 2001 04:36 PM </h4>

<p>OP fire is a very random thing, when an enemy moves or shoots, then all
friendly units have a chance to have &quot;balls put in&quot; to use the NBA
lottery analogy. The closer you are the &quot;more balls put in&quot; so to
speak, but anybody can be selected for OPFIRE. </p>

<p>SO as is alluded to above, using the range selection to limit the number of
units that &quot;have balls in&quot; will limit the potential shooters to those
that you want. </p>

<p>IF you are shot at though, there is a good chance that the range will be
reset automatically to allow you to fire back.</p>

<h4>Paul Vebber Member # 24 posted May 15, 2001 08:58 AM </h4>

<p>We have significantly upped the &quot;unsuppressed&quot; hit chances units
have -though the Soviets still have problems -its more crucial than ever to get
the initial licks in and cause suppression.</p>

<h4>Paul Vebber Administrator Member # 24posted July 22, 2001 11:13 AM</h4>

<p>Remember that the to hit chance is the chance of hitting, you still have to
kill it. Close assault chance is the chance of killing it outright (or at least
immobilizing it) SO if you have a 70% chance to hit but only a 20% chance to
kill it, your chance is only .7*.2 = .14 Also note that even if you fail to
kill it close assaulting you AUTOMATICALLY (hit or not) do about 10-20
suppression on the target</p>

<h4>Paul Vebber Administrator Member # 24 posted August 31, 2001 05:19 PM </h4>

<p>There are two aspects to cover - the protection given by the terrain in the
hex (i.e. rough is &quot;excellent&quot; see the manual for a terrain effects
listing (manual.pdf - view with adobe acrobat) </p>

<p>The other aspect is the state of the troops. Moving fast (2 hexes or more)
and the cover has much less effect. Move cautiously (1 hex) and the cover has
greater effect, stay stationary and move of the cover is available. Stay
stationary and get &quot;in -cover&quot; status to have full protection of the
cover. </p>

<p>Make sure you delete the steel.prf file whenever you add a new mech.exe or
the prefs can get weirded up...its in the SAVE folder.</p>

<p>In melee each man counts 1 point, grenades give you 1 bonus and FTs give a
BIG bonus, the total 'points' times a suppression and experience modifier give
a % chance for each man to 'hit' after a variety of &quot;gut check' rolls to
see if troops falter, cower, or go Berserk.</p>

<h4>Paul VebberAdministratorMember # 24posted July 23, 2001 09:25 PM</h4>

<p>AT the end of the turn there is a series of checks that result in automatic
suppression removal (like if you are close to a lot of friendly units
especially Command posts) or addition (if you are in a hex on fire).<br>
<br>
If you have 2/3 to 3/4 of your force retreated, routed or reduced below half
strength, then if your AO fails a morale check vs. Die(120), then your side is<br>
&quot;broken&quot;.<br>
<br>
During the end of turn suppression removal/addition all the troops belonging to
a broken force add 9 suppression, prior to the end of turn rally, so good
leadership<br>
can &quot;work through it&quot; but poor leadership or isolated units will
rapidly gain suppression over a few turns, generally keeping them at least
pinned.<br>
<br>
If you hold no objectives and your side is broken, then the game will usually
end.</p>

Could someone explain to me in detail what fire control, range finder, and the
radio rarity do?<br>
What happens if you don't have a radio?</p>

<p>Fire control is a modifier to hit moving targets, the better the rating, the
better your chance to hit a moving target. The formula in the manual is
modifier = 70 - ((target movement*3)+(fc*3)), but to make sense the movement
and fc should have different signs since movement makes it worse and fc makes
it better.<br>
<br>
Range finder is a measure of how far you can see to fire well. Take the range
finder value, add one and multiply by 6. That is how far you fire at normal
ability, between that and the (rf+1)*8 you are at .67 times normal. Beyond
(rf+1)*12 you are at .25 of normal with a minimum of 1% chance to hit. This
modifies the accuracy rating which is the range that you are at 50% to hit.
Take for example the 8.8cm l71 on the king tiger, it has an accuracy of 29 and
rangefinder of 8, (8+1)*6 means it fires normally out to 54 hexes, between 55
and 72 it is at .67 normal to hit. If however it had its rangefinder damaged
(reduced to 0?), it would fire normally out to range 6, at 29 hexes where it
would normally be 50% chance to hit it is now at 12.5% chance to hit<br>
<br>
Radio percentage is the chance that each unit will get a radio (that stays with
the crew if they bail). Radios are used for passing orders when C&amp;C is on
and units are further than 3 hexes from their ?0 unit. Radios are also used for
calling arty (you can search the threads for dedicated mortars without radios
thread). There needs to be a radio at each end (and an experience check passed)
for the radio link to work.<br>
<br>
If you don't have a radio, and have C&amp;C on, you better stay within 3 hexes
of your ?0 or the A0 if you want to change direction to meet a new threat. Any
arty unit without a radio has to be within 3 hexes of its calling unit to get
indirect firing orders.</p>

<h4>Paul Vebber Administrator Member # 24 posted September 28, 2001 03:32 PM </h4>

<p>Berserk/banzai It basically means they get an &quot;extra die roll&quot; to
pass the pre-melee &quot;gut check&quot; and if you pass you get to attack
before the defenders and they only attack back with the remainder (rather than
normal &quot;simultaneous resolution&quot;. You still may fend it off...but
chances are less.</p>

<h4>Paul Vebber Administrator Member # 24 posted September 17, 2001 01:38 PM </h4>

<p>The game uses three different routines to calculate casualties, and there is
'feedback' between them so that in some conditions, seemingly strange things
happen.<br>
<br>
When I tested this with MGs the target unit took 2/3 of casualties at range and
other units in the hex took 1/3, as the range decreased they proportion equalized
until about 4-5 hex range at which point the casualties where about even. Inside
4-5 hexes the non-target units in the hex start taking more damage. That was in
clear terrain. The terrain the hex plays in this as well, together with who is
pinned and who is moving and experience and some other cats and dogs.<br>
<br>
The whole thing grew to too many variables to analyze in the time I could allot
to it, so we just said so be it. Its not that big a deal.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is that a different set of mechanisms to determine when
casualties occur needs to be constructed, and that won't happen in SP:WaW. The
code is just too &quot;distributed&quot; to repair, and &quot;gut and
paste&quot; is out of the question - that cure is worse than the disease bug
wise...</p>

<h4>Flashfyre Matrix Veteran Member # 1531 posted July 10, 2001 01:39 AM </h4>

<p>Here's a designer's way to simulate fog on your map:<br>
<br>
Use the map in a separate scenario, using the same nations. Buy lots of
artillery batteries (of any size); depending on amount of fog and size of map,
I use the following guidelines:<br>
<br>
Small Map:6-8 batteries (6 for light, 8 for heavy)<br>
Medium Map: 8-12 batteries (8 for light, 12 for heavy)<br>
Large Map: 12-20 batteries (12 for light, 20 for heavy)<br>
<br>
Now, don't buy anything else; you should have an A0 for each side, and one side
with a bunch of arty. Deploy as usual; don't worry about the A0s...leave them
where they are. Go to the bombard screen, and pre-plot all your arty to fire
'SMOKE'. Scatter the individual missions to areas that you feel fog would
appear in real life; canyons, low spots, valleys, etc. Save the scenario as
something temporary....I usually call it 'test'.<br>
<br>
Exit the editor, and use Hotseat Play. This way the computer doesn't run either
side; you do. Start the scenario; the smoke missions will fire. When done, take
a look around the map; does the smoke look right? Is it in large clouds, or in
lines? If something doesn't look right, use the A0 unit to call for more smoke
missions (BTW...turn off C&amp;C when doing this). End the turn, and let the
smoke fire again. Check it as the other side. When it all looks ok, SAVE the
scenario.<br>
<br>
Now...exit the game (IMPORTANT: remember which saved game you used) and go to
the Save Game folder in the Steel Panthers folder. Rename the files for the
saved game to a scenario number (one that isn't being used) and move them to
the Scenario folder. Now, start the game and go to the editor; load the new
scenario (the one you renamed) and go to the map. There should be lots of 'fog'
on the battlefield. Now set weather to foggy, reduce the visibility to
something appropriate, and finish building the scenario.<br>
<br>
Now, when played, the fog effects will become apparent; low viz, with areas of
no visibility (due to the fog). Hope this helps.</p>

Originally posted by pbear: Ok here's what I'd like to do, the recon capability

<p>Technically, no. The 11 code gives a formation elite plus recon status. Code
10 gives Elite status. Code 1 gives recon status<br>
These codes only affect the units in a formation and not nested formations.<br>
<br>
So for a platoon with code 1, all units will have recon ability For a company
with code 1 only the commander and his transport (or any other unit) will have
recon ability. Usually, the company formations should have code 1 (or code 11)
since we assume that the commander does not have to expend orders by telling
himself what to do. Those formations within the company will retain the status
given to them in the formation list. In this way you can assign a platoon with
recon status but the recon company commander could be elite with recon status,
etc.</p>

<p>Paul Weber asked me to post this...to get some feedback from the fraternity
about this issue...I have nothing but admiration for the good work Paul does
and what he puts up with...thanks for all you do.<br>
<br>
I create a battle and change the nationalities... say change side 1 to Marines
or Italians. When I go to deploy, the Side 1 Nationality is on the right-hand
side of the map.<br>
<br>
If I leave the nationalities unchanged as the default (side 1 German)...the German
deployment occurs on the left-hand side of the map.<br>
<br>
Generating a battle with a random map works fine...just with side 1 on the RHS
of the map rather than the LHS...and with retreat/reinforcement flag on the
RHS.<br>
<br>
If I create a map using the editor the default for Side 1 for the retreat/reinforcement
flags are the LHS of the map. If I then generate a battle and change the
nationalities AND select custom map option, I find the units ready for
deployment on the correct side (Side 1 on LHS, but with the
retreat/reinforcement flags on the RHS of the map...that is the Marines are
deployed on the LHS but they retreat to the RHS directly into the Japs, and reinforcements
turn up behind enemy lines.<br>
<br>
If I deliberately switch the flags (side1 flags on RHS and side 2 on LHS), then
side 1 flags stay on the RHS...and the Marines still retreat into the Japs.<br>
<br>
Has anyone had experience of this...it may just be a bug in the installation I
have...<br>
<br>
The reason I have been using custom maps is often when I create a battle in
1943, I find the Marines facing the Japanese in the North African desert...the
battle creation routine doesn't seem to always choose the right theatre for the
battle.</p>

<h4>skukko Matrix Veteran Member # 1693 posted September 10, 2001 08:16 AM</h4>

<p>Did you change retreat flags also ?<br>
<br>
It should work. I just tested this. You'll have to keep players nation in there
where is German by default. Switch it to marines and player two to Japs. Click on
the random map and it creates a map where flags are ok. Marines deploy to right
hand side.<br>
<br>
Load a custom map that you have created and go to map-edit screen. There is
button with blue and green arrows, just under the save-map-button. Keep your
cursor over it and it tells you which side is Marines. If it says it is left,
click once and Marines start from right. Check flags and continue gaming.<br>
<br>
This is not a bug but behavior of editor.</p>

Load a custom map that you have created and go to map-edit screen. There is
button with blue and green arrows, just under the save-map-button.[QB]<br>
<br>
From what you describe, you found the same situation...i.e. side 1 deploying on
the map RHS if the nationality is changed in a generated battle with a
generated random map.<br>
<br>
But when I use an edited map, Side 1 deployment didn't swap sides! Side 1
deployed on the LHS. But, the Side 1 flags occurred on the RHS.<br>
<br>
Even if I placed the flags on the LHS using the map editor, the flags occurred
on the RHS when I created the battle with the custom map option.<br>
<br>
I thought player 1 set-up on the LHS by default regardless of nationality, so
to have player 1 deployment switch to the RHS is 1. confusing and 2. doubly
confusing if player 1 VH/start lines switch from LHS to RHS but the retreat/reinforcement
flags do not.<br>
<br>
I have to run more trials to test what you describe, but I was suspicious
whether changing map sides would affect the set-up , that is whether it is an
attribute of the map file or the data file...<br>
<br>
While this may be a work around, it still makes it difficult for a novice to
generate a battle with custom map, since 1. what they do is different depending
if they play with default (German side 1, soviet side 2) or alternative
nationality... 2. if they change the nationality they have to edit the map and
reverse the nationality side, and if they don't change the nationality they
leave it as is.</p>

<h4>skukko Matrix Veteran Member # 1693 posted September 11, 2001 01:53 AM</h4>

<p>*VBG*<br>
<br>
If you are changing map to user made map you are already editing ? ... LOL<br>
<br>
Now go to your editor and click 'load scenario'-button. Load that one from
where you want map to be changed. make sure Nationals are on correct places.
Lets put German to RHS and Marines on LHS.<br>
<br>
(This really needs custom map as it makes jungle map despite of selected
'random summer map', - which is almost correct as Marines didn't get many
changes to conquer Europe.)<br>
<br>
Click on the 'load map' -button. Pick it up. Now get in to map editor and look
what does say that 'Marines are on the --side of the map'-button, with blue and
green arrows. If it says that Marines are on the RHS then you'll have to click
this button to get them at left side. If it says left side then its ok. Either
way make Marines to left side.<br>
<br>
Now search reinforcement- and retreat- flags for Marines. They should be at
left side. If not you'll have to deploy them by hitting and clicking the map:
'0' (zero) for Marine retreat; 2,3,4,5 for reinforcements. Same for German: 1
for retreat 6,7,8,9, for reinforcements. Now we got them onboard.<br>
<br>
To avoid problems at deploy-phase get to deploy-screen and set Marines
deploy-line as well Germans line also. They probably are wrong by default.<br>
<br>
Save scenario. Load it again and do your purchase for both sides. Get to deploy
screen and look at the retreat/reinforcement flags. If they have gone to wrong
sides again, go to map-edit screen and deploy flags again. After these are in
right sides you can do deployment.<br>
<br>
And German is said to be as player 1 in HQ-menu, right ? Don't bother yourself with
it, they will fight against Marines that are also set as player ones troops. If
it does get you suspicious get to the Germans deploy-screen. You have A0 GeHQ
selected. Click 'F2' button to switch the side. It now is player 2. Hit 'G'-key
to get next formation, hit 'F2' and proceed further 'till you are back to Ge
HQ. ( Off board units need to be changed by finding them with 'N'-key and
hitting 'F2'. )<br>
<br>
Save it and test it.<br>
<br>
This is how scenario is built.<br>
<br>
Now we get into generated enemies:<br>

<p>Here are some things I&#8217;ve tried, which seem to work (I haven't got my PT boat
vs. Jap destroyers to working level yet). </p>

<p><strong>Calling in AI arty and air strikes later in the game;</strong> Use
this if you are planning an AI counter attack, say from a map edge the player
should have passed by already, and you want the AI to barrage a village which
is the target of the counterattack (and full of VH&#8217;s). Take away the radio from
the plane or arty. Assign them target hexes on a specific turn. If there is an
enemy unit (one of yours) near there intended target hex, they will fire. If
there aren&#8217;t any targets, they aren&#8217;t used. This can be especially good use of
Airpower to support an attack, by plotting it against obvious defensive
positions, which the AI just doesn&#8217;t do. Note that if is an artillery strike,
it will be bigger than normal, as it is a &#8216;1st turn&#8217; barrage. </p>

<p><strong>Difficult Terrain;</strong> To make some streams, swamps, etc.
slower traveling, add some dragons teeth or barbed wire to them. The problem is
that armored cars and tanks can just zip right through some of this terrain &#8211;
ok is some instances, but kind of unrealistic in others. Armored cars would
have a very difficult time moving through some wooded terrain, more so than is
reflected in the game. Adding obstacles (dragons teeth, wire) adds a new level
of difficulty in movement, but one which can be overcome by engineers doing a
bit of work. This can be very effective against a human, making the capture of
a bridge over a creek more important, because moving vehicle through the creek
requires engineers to spend 10-20 minutes (2-4 turns) preparing a path. This is
to simulate the need of engineers to remove logs, boulder, knock down steep
embankments, etc. A new graphic could be helpful here. </p>

<p><strong>Ranger or Force Recon raids using rubber boats;</strong> If you want
your light infantry to raid off of rubber boats instead of landing craft, make
the computer think the battle is a &#8216;river crossing&#8217;. 4-6 hexes out into the
ocean place a section of corral reef, and adjacent to that place a large
landing craft unit (as an auxiliary). Make the player &#8216;deploy&#8217; onto the corral
reef. Once the battle starts &#8211; when the units move towards land &#8211; they&#8217;ll go
into their rubber boats. This is a fun technique for early pacific battles.
I&#8217;ve forgot how to make the battles a &#8216;river crossing&#8217;, but I think it is
F.C.&#8217;s editor. </p>

<p><strong>Using Victory Hexes to force the AI to use good tactics</strong>.
Skukko has some good info on how the AI responds to Victory Hexes. From what
he&#8217;s told me, and my experiments, the AI will send infantry after low cost
objectives (100 points), and the Armor after the high cost ones (250 points).
Use this to send the AI infantry into the woods, and keep their tanks in the
open. In other words, use the AI programming to force the AI to use good
tactics, even if it means some VH&#8217;s aren&#8217;t in the most logical tactical locations.
</p>

<p>Used in conjunction with VH which show up late in the game on queue with AI
reinforcements, you can make the AI maneuver in a tactical way. For example, AI
reinforcements show up on turn 8, and new 100p and 250p VH show up as well,
near the AI. AI sends tanks to 250p, and inf. to 100p. then, on turn 11 a new
250p. VH shows up, which the AI now sends its armor to (after reaching the one
that show up on turn 8). You can get the AI to maneuver in a fairly tactical
path, but the player won&#8217;t know what it is until the objectives become visible.
Used in conjunction with late arriving air and artillery, and you can get a
pretty tactically proficient AI attack or counter attack. </p>

<p><strong>Hi. Anyone knows how to make Air drops as reinforcements?</strong>
All I can do is assign them to appear on turn 1. Tried several things in order
to make them appear later on a battle (turn 7 or something) but nothing seems
to work.<br>
<br>
I saw in a scenario (Utah Beach) that this is possible but I don't know if this
is a special configuration for a scenario or not.<br>
<br>
Additional question 1: What can we load on Cargo Gliders? Can we load Tanks? Is
there any way to transport tanks to join the airborne troops?<br>
<br>
Additional question 2: Is it possible to reserve some of our troops to appear
as reinforcements later on instead of just deploy them?</p>

<h4>sebagonzalez Matrix Recruit Member # 4252 posted November 02, 2001 06:47 AM</h4>

<p>In my Maleme scenario I had to make paratroopers come in turn 2, and for
this u have to change (ETA) Estimated Time of Arrival, that is changed in the
screen where u assign parachute drops in the terrain, is above and is a little
small, its next to the switch that lets u choose from where on the map u want
them to come and from where to leave. U must change ETA before assigning paratroops
in the terrain, otherwise the game will launch them on first turn.</p>

1) To set the arrival time, first set your drop point, then cancel it. Now hit
&quot;T&quot; on your keyboard. Choose the time you want them to show up, then
reset you drop point. All other units listed after the first should now
automatically show the new arrival turn. If you want part to come in on a
different turn, just do the same &quot;T&quot; thing, and units in the list
under that one will show the new turn.<br>
<br>
2) I doubt you can load a tank on a glider, but I know you can load Jeeps and
small guns. Experiment with it. (You can also check &quot;Carry Cost/Carry
Capacity&quot; to get an idea.)<br>
<br>
3) For regular troop to be reinforcements, you need to set reinforcement flags
using the map editor, then choose a flag &amp; turn for each unit. Another good
way to have troops come on later is to use &quot;Reaction&quot; turns. In you
HQ list you'll see the Reaction button at the bottom left, select the unit and
set the turn. They won't move (AI willing) until that turn. Just make sure you
don't deploy them in LOS of the enemy!</p>

<p>1) I tested it and works fine.<br>
<br>
2) Made a lot of experiments with the Americans. The only vehicle that I could
load in a cargo glider was the small jeep that comes with an airborne company. Tried
also recon jeeps, tanks, halftracks, command cars, ammo trucks and even pack
mules, all I get was the &quot;too heavy&quot; message referring always to the
vehicle. Apparently the airborne jeeps have a special thing that allows the
program to recognize the vehicle as &quot;boardable&quot; by Gliders.<br>
<br>
3) Apparently this only works if I use the Editor to set a scenario. No
Reaction button at the HQ menu at the deploy for Random Battle. Also tried to
make regular troops appear as reinforcement at the edge default reinforcement
points and didn't work.</p>

<p>BTW: Did anybody tried ectizens SDQ yet?<br>
<br>
http://image2.ectopia.net/spwaw/SDQuickies-beta2.zip<br>
<br>
Lots of fairly easy and unusual terrain edits to do with this fine little tool.
At least it&#8217;s not as awkward to use than reading my Terrain Edit Document file.<br>
<br>
My 10 cents: If you want to have (as designer) a less predictable AI in your
scenario, then make more use of the &quot;AI reaction&quot; Victory hexes! I
would go as far as not placing any of the usual &quot;end game or per
turn&quot; style VH at all. As human player you would keep guessing (in defense
scenario) what the AI goals are. How could you always know anyway, what the
enemies intentions are and what map locations are important to him? Place the
usual VH stuff on the map and you know where the AI is going to! ...boring!<br>
<br>
Why not making use of printable SP:WaW maps with complete briefings and orders,
so the player has something to look at, while playing the scenario? I always
found the info in the scenario description file quite nice, but would prefer to
have it also available during game play.<br>
<br>
Again..ectizens &quot;MapThing&quot; provides a usable solution, for this kind
of maps.<br>
<br>
I also found a more or less easy way to provide the player with an orders
system, that enables the player to receive orders from higher HQ during the
course of the game (see italy44 scenario).<br>
<br>
With a little bit of creativity, SP:WaW can be expanded with more features,
without changing any program code or OOB.</p>

<p>I've been modifying slightly my OOB files, especially mortars. But I found
some German equipment in the Czech OOB, which I'd like to put into use now. I
tried to make them available in Czech purchase screen, but without any luck. I
did everything similarly as before (I got German Maus tank into German purchase
screen without problems) but no luck with Czech OOB. Any special tricks here??</p>

<h5>pax27 Matrix Recruit Member # 4589 posted November 07, 2001 06:45 AM</h5>

<p>In the OOB editor (the one that came with the game) under &quot;Radio&quot;
you have a number ending with 3, like 93 in most cases with the German units in
Czech OOB. This is in fact the rarity rating of the equipment. A three would
mean that the equipment can&#8217;t appear as a normal piece of equip in the purchase
menus in SP:WaW. Changing this to digit below three would make the equip appear
in the purchase menu. Of course you have to change the &quot;Avail from&quot;
date from December 49 (to whatever) in those cases, but I think you knew that.
Also, when you have changed the rarity rating you may have to change the
&quot;Class&quot; of the equip. An example: the Tiger II P2Turm is classified
as &quot;14 - Heavy Tank&quot; in the Czech OOB, but the Czech purchase menu doesn&#8217;t
have a &quot;Heavy Tank&quot; sub-menu. This is much like the Maus, classified
as &quot;Very Heavy Tank&quot; in German OOB, a class that wont appear in the German
purchase menu, so you can&#8217;t buy the Maus unless you change it to &quot;Heavy
Tank&quot; or something that does exist. If you want you can also create your
own &quot;Heavy Tank&quot; (or whatever) formation under the
&quot;Formations&quot; part of the OOB editor, which might be in place in this </p>

<p>During both the German invasion of Holland during Operation Sickle in 1940
and the allied Operation Overlord in 1944 decoy paratroopers were dropped along
with the real troopers to confuse the enemy as to the strength and objectives
of paratroops involved in these operations. Would there be any way to
incorporate such decoys into the OOBs of the Germans and Allies?</p>

<h4>Redleg Matrix Veteran Member # 420 posted November 07, 2001 11:10 PM</h4>

<p>I believe you could do this using the explosion icon in Norway Dec49. Load a
bunch of those little dudes on 2-3 aircraft and scatter them all over the
place. They have no movement, no weapons but will go &quot;boom&quot; when
shot. Maybe the dummies have some sort of device on them that would pop when
shot. No need to dink with the oobs if you did this. I didn't try it but it
should work. Or try using ammunition canisters. They only weigh 2 each so
several can go on a plane. </p>

<h4>ost soldier Matrix Recruit Member # 3993 posted October 05, 2001 01:56 PM</h4>

<p>It works much like an overrun. Move a personnel unit into the same hex as an
enemy and press alt-M. A cautious<br>
advance (moving from adjacent) is usually better than a 2 or 3 hex run. Make
sure you out number the enemy by at<br>
least 2 or 3 men. The computer yells Charge!/Banzai! there are grunts and
howls, and you get a casualty count. I<br>
have found melees to be very risky. Keep in mind to saying about a knife in a
gunfight. </p>

<h4>Overrun?</h4>

<h4>Paul Vebber Administrator Member # 24 posted June 27, 2001 01:20 PM</h4>

<p>Tracked vehicles with MGs can overrun - enter the same hex using the shift

Melee is similar but vs. infantry.</p>

<h4>Del Matrix Veteran Member # 3031 posted July 21, 2001 06:01 PM</h4>

<p>I've moved two units next to a German tank in the forest. The tank has no
infantry support. It's ripe for the picking. I attack with a depleted Guard
infantry squad first. The percentage to fire on it is very favorable, 73%. But
when I attack the tank the game dose it as a close assault and I get only a 7%
chance. The attack fails of course and the tank wipes out the rest of the
squad. Round two. I still have the RPG unit next to the tank. The tank has
exposed it's flank to the RPG squad so it could shoot at the depleted infantry
squad and it's buttoned. The RPG squads to hit chance is 78%. When I go to
attack the tank I know as sure as I'm sitting here crying over the loss of my
infantry that the percentage will drop to 12% or less. How do I get the RPG
squad to fire it's weapon instead of close assaulting? </p>

<h4>El Vito Matrix Recruit Member # 2835 posted July 21, 2001 06:26 PM </h4>

<p>Target the unit with the T button then use the C button to choose the number
of the weapon you wish to use exclusively. I have had the same problem so I
just use the squad AT weapon to avoid assaulting.</p>

<h4>Paul Vebber Administrator Member # 24posted July 22, 2001 11:13 AM</h4>

<p>Remember that the to hit chance is the chance of hitting, you still have to
kill it. Close assault chance is the chance of killing it outright (or at least
immobilizing it) SO if you have a 70% chance to hit but only a 20% chance to
kill it, your chance is only .7*.2 = .14 Also note that even if you fail to
kill it close assaulting you AUTOMATICALLY (hit or not) do about 10-20
suppression on the target</p>

<h4>Mai Thai Matrix Veteran Member # 3027 posted August 27, 2001 02:00 AM </h4>

<p>I hope you changed the ETA before you assigned the drop hex to the cargo
aircrafts and that you clicked the target hex for each unit before choosing
them and, by anyway, in the deploying screen you must see the little round
parachute icon on the hex you assigned as target, if you don't see it you did
some mistake and remember, AFAIK, para can be assigned in deploy screen only.</p>

<p><strong>Lay mine during a game (not during setup)</strong></p>

<h4>fdlu Matrix Veteran Member # 382 posted June 07, 2000 05:04 PM </h4>

<p>This may be a stupid question, or answered earlier. I read under new
features that leg engineers are able to lay mines in game. how do I do this.
thanks for any help. BTW , is there a game play difference between the
different infantry units ?? (aside from snipers, engineer but heavy, elite
etc.) </p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Select the engineer unit and click on it. In the
unit information screen click on the line that says: &quot;Clear mines in front
of the unit.&quot; which is the default. You can change it to &quot;Lay
mines...&quot; or &quot;Don't clear...&quot; Engineers don't lay mines every
turn. Their rate of laying depends upon their experience and suppression. <br>
Some terrain seems to be easier to lay mines in too. You do not need to
purchase mines for them to lay, this is an inherent capability and is not
effected by ammunition loads, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Load vehicles onto a ferry or truck?:</strong></p>

<h4>2r06 Matrix Recruit Member # 4568 posted October 17, 2001 07:35 AM </h4>

<p>I am new to SP:WaW and this forum. I am playing the &quot;A Long Long Road to
Victory&quot; campaign. I got a draw on the first battle (wasn't aggressive
enough). The second battle is a delay/ river crossing/ evacuate the bridgehead.
The scenario provides you with LCM's. I can get infantry into them by having
the LCM occupy the same hex as the LCM and then Loading) them. But I can't get
the tanks to occupy the same hex. Tried it on the docks and tried it on the
beach. I can't find anyplace to have them both occupy the same hex. When I try
to load with the units adjacent it says the tank is too far away. I'm pretty
sure the LCM's are big enough to hold the tanks. It won't load the Halftracks
either. </p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Move your unit to a hex adjacent to the ferry,
click on the ferry to select it then hit the &quot;L&quot; key then click on
the unit to be loaded. You cannot load into a ferry by clicking on the
passenger unit as you can with a truck. If the passenger is itself loaded with
a passenger (e.g. a truck with troops in it) it will not load. Only empty
vehicles may load onto a ferry. If the ferry has no MP's left when it gets to
the bank, it will not unload.</p>

<h4>Torbin Matrix Recruit Member # 2531 posted February 13, 2001 04:21 AM </h4>

<h4>Resisti Matrix Veteran Member # 2409 posted February 13, 2001 04:27 AM </h4>

<p>First of all,yr troops must be in the same hex as the vehicle. Then, two
ways: 1)you select the truck(or whatever it is),then you click on the load
button (&quot;L&quot;) on the right side of the screen, then you select the
troop you want to be loaded; 2)you select the troops you want to load, then you
click on the load button as above, then you click the truck you want yr troops
to be loaded onto. </p>

<p><strong>Reload ammunition for units?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Move next to or on top of a ammo truck or dump. An
ammo dump can reload faster than an ammo truck can. Either has a fixed reload
rate which is split amongst the number of units reloading. HE is loaded first
then AP, even for units that are primarily AT units. Smoke cannot be reloaded.</p>

<h4>RockinHarry Matrix Veteran Member # 2382 posted August 26, 2001 12:07 PM </h4>

<p>very good question! I think smoke is abstractly related to the slot1 weapon
(gun for tanks,..rifles for infantry etc.) although it doesn&#8217;t actually has
something to do with them ammo load-wise. Generally if a unit looses its slot1
weapon then it strangely also looses its smoke throwing capability. Example:
Main gun (slot1) weapon destroyed in combat and crew bails out. This bailed out
crew also has as its tank no slot1 weapon anymore (in this case mostly &quot;miscellaneous
small arms&quot;) means it also has lost its anyway annoying smoke throwing
ability. (stone old topic) </p>

Unfortunately you cannot fire multiple weapons at range of 1 or 0, its fire one
weapon or close assault. Additionally, this only works during your turn. During
OPFIRE the unit will close assault if it has any shots available in a weapon
that can do so. You could select your unit, hit the space bar then turn off all
close assaulting weapons (hand grenades, mines, etc.) leaving only rifles, etc.</p>
