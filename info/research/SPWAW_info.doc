* Max amount of units in hex: 16

	data   = 0x50 ... (size = header[4..7])
	
* Higher experience numbers indicate a unit that will shoot better, be
tougher on defense, and degrade in status more slowly under enemy fire.
Experienced units are less susceptible to suppression, have a better chance
to hit enemy units, spot enemy units better, are harder to spot themselves,
and close assault tanks better. There are four basic experience levels:
Green (30- 49), Average (50-79), Veteran (80-99), and Elite (100+). Units
gain experience at the end of each mission if you are playing a campaign
game. Unit experience does not change during a game. The range is 30 to 140
experience points. Elite units, for example, are units that have over 100
experience points.

* If 2/3 of your units are dead, routed, or reduced to 50% strength or less,
their force morale can be “broken”. This also requires the AO to fail a
morale check (Die(120> morale). Any turn in which theses conditions apply
and the AO fails this check, and one side has the preponderance of victory
hexes, the game can end before the allotted time.

Scenario designers can mitigate this by giving the A0 120 morale and the
player protecting it. In addition to the possible early end of the game, the
effect of Force Morale breaking is to add suppression to every unit in the
force at the end of each turn.
