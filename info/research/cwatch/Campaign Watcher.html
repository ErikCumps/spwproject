<p class="section">Installation</p>
<p class="subsection">Installer</p>
<p>After running the setup program, you will be able to run Campaign Watcher from the start menu.</p>



<p class="section">Overview</p>
<p class="subsection">Definitions</p>
<ul>
  <li>All information for a single campaign is stored in a <span class="definition">record.</span></li>
  <li>Data extracted from SPWaW saves is stored in a <span class="definition">snapshot</span>.
    Together snapshots form a record.<br>
    <span class="hint">Note:</span> After the snapshot has been taken, you don't need the savefile anymore for the operation of CW. </li>
    <li>The <span class="definition">core force</span> are the troops you keep throughout the campaign</li>
    <li>An <span class="definition">element</span> is a single unit of the core force.</li>
    <li><span class="definition">Unit</span> is used synonymously to either element or core force.</li>
</ul>
<p class="subsection">Layout</p>
<p>The user interface of Campaign Watcher is organized into the following tabs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="prg_caption">Records</span> - Here you can manage your records, add new snapshots and set default folders. </li>
  <li><span class="prg_caption">Roster</span> - This tab shows a list of the core units in a snapshot and all changes compared to the last snapshot.</li>
  <li><span class="prg_caption">Pers. Files</span>This displays the changes for a single element across all snapshots.</li>
  <li><span class="prg_caption">Report</span> - This are various status informations compiled from a single snapshot. </li>
  <li><span class="prg_caption">Graphs</span> - Graphical representations for a number of statistics.</li>
  <li><span class="prg_caption">Options</span> - This tab offers settings for default window size and printing.</li>
</ul>
<p class="subsection">Configuration</p>
<p>When you start <span class="prg_name">Campaign Watcher for the first time,
  you should set some default paths.</span> You can define up to five folders where <span class="prg_name">Campaign Watcher</span> will look for new saves.
  Additionaly, you can set one folder where information in CSV format can be exported to.</p>
<p>To set the paths:</p>
<ol>
  <li>select the folder you want to set from the list</li>
  <li>use the drive/directory boxes to change the path</li>
  <li>click Set Folder</li>
</ol>
<p>From now on, you can change to these folders directly by clicking on them. The
  path to the selected folder is shown below the list of folders.</p>
<p><span class="hint">Note</span>: An invalid path is shown in red.</p>



<p class="section">Tab: Records</p>
<p class="subsection">Creating a record</p>
<p>Click on <span class="prg_caption">New record. </span>You will be prompted
  for a filename and a title for the record. The filename appears in the listbox
  to the left and becomes the current record. The filename and the title are displayed
  at the top of the window. This title will also be the header for all printouts. </p>
<p>To change the title later, doubleclick the titlebar at the top of the window.</p>
<p>The listbox to the right on the <i>Records </i>tab will show saves of which snapshots have already been taken and added to the current record grayed
    out. </p>

<p class="subsection">Taking snapshots</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select the save(s) you want to include in
  the record from the list to the right. For best results, saves from the very
  start of each battle are recommended. (See also <span class="docu_caption"><a target="mainFrame" href="http://campaignwatcher.abross.de/manual.html#additional_info_hints">Additional
  Information</a></span> below.)<br>
  You can select multiple saves by using the standard Windows mouse/key combinations
  (SHIFT/CTRL).<br>
  For each save, the filename and the date in MM/DD/YY, HH (Turn) format are shown.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="prg_caption">Add Snapshot(s)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>  You need to add at least one snapshot to be able to use the Roster
  tab and at least two to be able to use the Graphs tab.</p>
<p><span class="hint">Note:</span> As far as I know, saving is handled automatically for Mega Campaigns. So to take a snapshot at the start of a battle
you probably have to exit the game, take the snapshot and return.</p>



<p class="section">Tab: Roster</p>
<p>The roster tab
  displays information on all units in a snapshot. In the box to the right you
  see a list of snapshots sorted by date/turn. The format of the dates is MM/DD/YY, HH (Turn).<br>
  The buttons <span class="prg_caption">Prev</span> and <span style="">1st</span> toggle between different display modes:
  </p><ul><li><span class="prg_caption">Prev</span> pressed: compare to previous snapshot</li>
  <li><span class="prg_caption">1st</span> pressed: compare to first snapshot</li>
  <li>both depressed: don't compare</li>
</ul>
<p>
The meanings of the colors used are: <font color="#006600">good</font>,
    <font color="#000099">neutra</font><font color="#000099">l,</font> <font color="#cc0000">bad</font>. An asterisk denotes a bailed crew.
</p>

<p><span class="hint">
Note: To sort the table by different columns, click on the table headers.</span></p>

<p class="subsection">Exporting the roster</p>
<p>Above the snapshot list are two buttons, which both will export the roster
  in CSV format (the tabulator character will be the delimiter).</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="prg_caption">C</span> - Export to clipboard.</li>
  <li><span class="prg_caption">E</span> - Export to file. You can choose the
    path were the files will be created by setting the <span class="prg_caption">CSV
    export</span> folder on the <span class="prg_caption">Records</span> tab.</li>
</ul>
<p class="subsection">Printing the roster</p>
<p>Click on the <span class="prg_caption">Printer Setup</span> button to configure
  your printer. See also tab <span class="prg_caption">Options</span>. Click
  on <span class="prg_caption">Print</span> to send the currently displayed snapshot
  to the printer.</p>

<p class="section">Tab: Element history</p>

<p>This tab works like the Roster tab, but instead of comparing two snapshots for all elements it compares all snapshot for a single element.</p>

<p class="section">Tab: Report</p>
<p>The Report tells you at a glance which units are the most experienced, have
  the most kills etc. You could gather the same data by looking at the Roster, but using the Report should be more convenient.</p>

<p class="section">Tab: Graphs</p>
<p>Click on the <i>Graphs</i> tab for a number of graphs that visualize the development
  of your forces over the timeframe covered by all snapshots.</p>
<p>If you select <span class="prg_caption">Show turns</span>, multiple turns for
  a given date (i.e. a single battle) will be spread out along the x-axis. Otherwise the first and last
  turn (if available) for a single date are displayed. In neither case will the
  graphs show values for more than one snapshot from the same date <b>and</b> turn.</p>
<p>The <span class="prg_caption">Kills/Losses</span> graph is not affected by
  the <span class="prg_caption">Show turns</span> button.</p>
<p>You can select a unit class from the second dropdown box to filter the graphs by unit class. The filter is ignored by the
<span class="prg_caption">Force Composition</span> and <span class="prg_caption">Kills/Losses</span> graphs.</p>


<p class="subsection">Printing the graphs</p>
<p>Click on the <span class="prg_caption">Printer Setup</span> button to configure
  your printer. See also tab Options. Click on <span class="prg_caption">Print</span>
  to send the currently displayed graph to the printer.</p>

  <p class="section">Tab: Options</p>
<p>Here you can set window behaviour and printing options. Changes will come in
  effect once you hit <span class="prg_caption">Apply</span>.</p>
<p class="subsection">Window size</p>
<p>You can choose from <span class="prg_caption">800 x 600</span>,
<span class="prg_caption">1024 x 768</span>,
<span class="prg_caption">Custom</span>
  and <span class="prg_caption">Maximized</span> window sizes.<br> Note that custom mode acts differently from the other options.
  If custom is selected, pressing apply will cause the program to remember its current position and size.
  In all other modes, hitting apply changes the window size to the selected value.
</p>
<p class="subsection">Roster printing</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="prg_caption">Color</span> - As seen on the screen.</li>
  <li><span class="prg_caption">Font styles</span> - Different font styles are
    used to mark the changes.</li>
  <li><span class="prg_caption">None</span> - Changes are not marked.</li>
</ul>
<p class="subsection">Graph printing</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="prg_caption">Color</span> - As seen on the screen.</li>
  <li><span class="prg_caption">Greyscales</span> - Optimized greyscale palette
    instead of colors.</li>
</ul>
<p class="section">Additional information<a target="mainFrame" name="additional_info_hints"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li>The recommended turns for taking snapshots are either turn 0, before you click on "Quit Deploy" or turn 1, before you've done anything else.<br>
    To also record KIAs and to improve accuracy for the <span class="prg_caption">Kills/Losses</span> graph, additionaly take one  snapshot from the last turn of each
    battle.
  </li>
  <li>More snapshots won't hurt; not taking snapshots from the recommended turns will lessen accuracy of results.</li>
  <li>Don't worry about taking snapshots in the correct order, as they will be sorted
    automatically.</li>
  <li>Duplicate snapshots will be filtered out.</li>

</ul>
<p class="section">Known issues &amp; limitations</p>
<ul>
  <li>The values for the <span class="prg_caption">Kills/Losses</span> graph and
    the <span class="prg_caption">Kills since last battle</span> figure on the
    Report tab may be slightly off.</li>
  <li>Sometimes a formation leader gets killed and one of his subordinates takes
    control. <br>
    e.g. B0,B1,B2; B0 killed; B1 becomes new B0<br>
    In these cases, CW will compare the new B0 to the old B0.<br>
    <span class="hint">Note:</span> CW should handle manually reattached
    units without any problems.</li>
